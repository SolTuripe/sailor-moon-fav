A little exercise to practice react. \
This project shows my favorite sailor scouts using a fake api âœ¨

## Project setup

git clone https://github.com/SolTuripe/sailor-moon-fav.git
cd sailor-moon-fav
npm install
```

## In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
